I list below some identified open problems and some result we have so far.


\begin{open}
	The decidability of the class full word equation + no contains constraint.
\end{open}

\begin{open}
	The decidability of the class quadratic word equation + no contains constraint is decidable.
\end{open}

\begin{open}
	The decidability of the class straight-line word equation + no contains constraint + length constraints.
\end{open}


\begin{lemma}
The class straight-line word equation + no contains constraint is decidable.
\end{lemma}
